Four separate analyses are run as part of the project, on four different data sets:

1) English ratings (this also includes the etymology stuff)
2) Indo-European based on Google Translations
3) Hungarian ratings
4) Cross-linguistic data (excluding all Indo-European languages + Hungarian)

Raw data files are in raw_data, arranged by analysis.
Final data files are in final_data.
Data processing scripts are in data_processing.
The model folder might be unnecessary â€“ I think I started saving some models, but then didn't really do it in the end.
The analysis is all in rough_r_master_analysis.Rmd.
